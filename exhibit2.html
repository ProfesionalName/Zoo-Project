<h1>Tigers</h1>
<p>The tiger is a very common animal you can see it as a logo/mascot in many places. The tiger is a carnivore which means they eat meat. The tiger can live for up to 10 years. The tiger can also weigh up to 500 pounds which is a lot compared to the other animals. Depending on the type of tiger they can stay in different tempatures. There are tigers that live in cold and some live in the warmer climate. But tigers are really just big cats they still like to play and run around they are just way more of a danger.</p>
